The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.<br />
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.<br />
BUT, if the player rolls a 1 on dice then all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.<br />
And, if the player rolls two consecutive 6 then all his/her Global score will be lost i.e. 0.<br />
The player can choose to 'SWAP', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.<br />
The first player to reach 50 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.<br />
